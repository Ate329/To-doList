# To-doList
This is a simple To-Do List application implemented in Python using the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface. The application allows users to add, delete, load, and save tasks. It also provides the functionality to mark tasks as done or undone. Additionally, the application supports switching between a detailed task view and a grouped view based on task importance.

# How to use
1. Run Main.py to start the To-Do List application.     

2. Use the buttons to add, delete, load, and save tasks.    

3. Double-click on a task in the list to mark it as done or undone.     

4. Switch between the detailed and grouped view using the "Switch Table" button.    

**Note: Make sure to have the required libraries (tkinter, ttkthemes, pandas) installed before running the application.**   

or you can install the libraries by
